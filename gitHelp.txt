WHAT YOU SHOULD DO EVERY TIME YOU WORK
	When you start:
		git pull
		git pull origin master
	When you finish:
		git pull
		git commit 
		git push
		prob do a pull request (its on github)


Helpful commands to make sense of life:
git checkout -b nameOfBranchHere
	this will checkout a new branch with the name specified
	p.s. NEVER WORK FROM THE MASTER BRANCH WWWEEEEE WIILLLL FIGHT
git checkout branchName
	this will checkout a branch by the name specified
git push --set-upstream origin branchName
	do this after you create a new branch, it lets everyone else see it
git pull origin master 
	this will give you all the files other people have added
git pull
	this will give you all the files other people have added to your branch
git commit -m "type your commit message here"
	this will add files you've changed to the list to be pushed
	p.s. don't commit without a commit message
git push
	this will push the files you've committed to your network branch
do a pull request (not a command) //this is done through github
	this will allow the person over the master branch to add your branch back into master

git commit
	esc + :wq if you have done git commit


if all this is blowing your freaking mind..... There's tortiose git (probably not how its spelled(is it spelt))
Tortiose git has equivelent commands for some of these all with a pretty little gui
right click the file you want to commit for, then go to TG section and click "git commit -> branchName"
You can find pull and push under the TG submenu
